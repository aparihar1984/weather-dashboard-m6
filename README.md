Module 6 Challenge Involving Building a Weather Dashboard!

Creating a functioning Weather Dashboard.

## Introduction
For this assignment, I built a Weather Dashboard that allows the user to enter a city into an input/search box. An API request is then made to retrieve a specified set of weather data which is then displayed on the dashboard for that respective city.  The Weather Dashboard features HTML and CSS pages powered by JavaScript.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a Weather Dashboard using a JavaScript file that features the following:

When the user searches for a city by entering a city into the search box, they are then presented with the current conditions for that city, and that city is subsequently added to the search history.

When the user views the current weather conditions for the entered city, they are then presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.

When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are once again presented with the current conditions for that city.

## References
To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 6-Server-Side-APIs Class Files as references:

"03-Ins_Demo-Fetch" 
"07-Ins_Demo_Parse" 
"21-Ins_Review-Part-One"
"23-Ins_Review-Part-Two"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/CodyG-2021/06-Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard" 
"https://github.com/jmrendon48/weather-dashboard-6"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria for our specific assignment. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
